        The scenario
    </h3>
    
    <p class=" pl-2 font-quicksand font-weight-bold ">
        The short story is told through the perspective of Montresor. We read his perspective as he lures an old enemy, Fortunato, to the depths of the Montresor family catacombs. Montresor promises an entire cask of Amontillado to the already drunk Fortunato. As a wine enthusiast, Fortunato is lured further and further before being shackled to the floor. It's not looking good for the festive Fortunato.  
    </p>

<div class="direct-reg margin-auto">
    <p class=" pl-2 font-quicksand font-weight-bold">
    After reading the story, it's easy to see Montresor as a murderous psychopath. The character seemed hellbent on exacting his revenge. But it's possible to examine closer and understand how Poe wrote Montresor as a self-conscious and somewhat insecure killer. Various coping mechanisms exist through the last five interactions between the two characters. If the details are read, the character instead is a stubborn man struggling to cope with a premeditated plan of murder. These interactions start as Montresor started to form the brick wall encasing Fortunato.

	After Montresor scarcely laid the first course of stone, Fortunato began to cry. Montresor saw this not as the drunk man he lured down the catacombs, but as a man equal to him. He described the cry as a “low, moaning sound.” This showed that within the first course, Montresor was already feeling uncertain. He scarcely laid the first row- he was in a hurry. He wants it to be over sooner. His captor, shackled in the depths of a catacomb, started crying. Montresor realized he would need to be resilient and continued with his decision of revenge, most notable in his “obstinate silence” that he waits for to continue building the wall. He does this because he couldn't continue while Fortunato cried, reminding him of life. Instead, he had the stubbornness the stick with his decision.

	       	 Montresor continued placing the wall rather quickly, showing his uncertainty. As he finished the fourth course, he heard “furious vibrations” from the chains. He didn't describe the noise coming from a person, but rather from the chains. This showed his resilience in dehumanization Fortunato as a coping mechanism. This dehumanization tactic worked so well that he admitted to hearkening, or listening, to the noises for several minutes. Perhaps fueled from his captor's noise, Montresor at first seemed apathetic. But instead of enjoying the sounds, he waited for the chain noises to stop. Montresor sat in the bones of his family, almost as if he needed that reassurance from his dead relatives to be able to complete this task. This was the first time he does this as a coping mechanism. 
	    </p>
       <p class=" font-quicksand font-weight-bold">
           Only after the “clanking subsided” does Montresor continue.

	     The wall was up to his chest at this point when he reached decided to throw a “feeble ray” of light from his torch into the enclosure onto the “figure within.” By not addressing Fortunato as a person and feebly “throwing” rays of light, he acknowledged the need to check on his victim. However, he can't will himself to focus on the man.<br>
	     That feeble light gave Fortunato the strength to yell “loud and shrill screams.” These screams pushed Montresor back. These screams came <i>just</i> when Montresor was gaining confidence. Montresor trembled, hesitated. He almost unsheathed his knife (rapier) to end things sooner. He lost a little control. But as he reached for his knife, he again gained reassurance from the silenced bones of his ancestors. This recurring coping mechanism reassured Montresor to confidence and satisfaction. He rode his adrenaline high and took a step back. He screamed <i>with</i> Fortunato. In fact, he even surpassed the dead man's screams in volume and strength. At this point, Montresor committed entirely. His screaming brought absolute silence.

    The clock hit midnight and the fourth interaction started. Montresor placed the next four courses of brick with an apparently absent mind. He nearly placed the last stone when Fortunato released a low laugh that “erects the hairs on the back of [Montresor’s] neck.” Montresor was scared... despite nearing the finish. He was pulled back to reality when he heard Fortunato's sad, low hums. Fortunato and Montresor talked as Fortunato experienced denial. The man begged for his life. He ended his cries with a prayer to God. Montresor mocked God. The killer gained confidence, but he wasn't some stone cold killer. Instead, he called out to Fortunato twice to no avail. Montresor was vulnerable and weak. He depended on a rebuttal- the blissful distraction. He ached for Fortunato’s response. He grew impatient.

Montresor dropped his torch desperately into the room. He expected a reaction. Instead, he only heard the jingling of the bells on Fortunato’s hat. The disembodied, dehumanized response that Montresor was responsible for. This was the most critical moment in the humanization of Montresor- he admitted that “his heart felt sick.” Instead of hiding behind an illusion, he showed his true fears. The reality of murder hit Montresor, but by then he had completed. He quickly blamed the dampness of the air to disguise his guilt, then hastened to end his wall. It was not fun anymore. After putting the last brick in place, he pushed the “old rampart bones” back up against the wall as a defense. For the third time, Montresor looked to his dead relatives’ bones for protection and to help cope. Montresor did not acknowledge Fortunato- only his family. He struggled to cope and used the latin phrase, <i>In peace may he rest</i>, to try to reassure the audience that he went through every means necessary to exact revenge. But this illusionary evil is muddied by the subtle coping mechanisms he experienced throughout erecting the wall. He wasn't the psychopathic, emotionless, apathetic character that he attempted to portray himself as.
