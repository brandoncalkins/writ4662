The process of learning Github was fairly straightforward. Uploading files to make a repository was simple enough, however making a git Page was frustrating. I still don't know why my page isn't running, but the feature is little importance to me currently. If I were working on a project that required multiple people, I think git would be useful for the collaborative writing possible. But as of now, I've never had to collaborate code with anyone yet. I am assuming that's the most useful detail of gitHub- that it's specifically made to collaborate and preview code (rather than Drive which is meant to view/share download files). I'd continue to use github if I had a reason to collaborate with others.
